My main responsibility is to ensure that systems and users operate smoothly without downtime. 
I troubleshoot network-related issues such as IP conflicts and connectivity problems, sometimes using tools like PuTTY and the command line.. 
I also handle domain-related tasks, including joining computers to the domain and remotely connecting to user machines to diagnose and fix issues using Net support.
